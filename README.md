### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Joey Fitzpatrick, a software developer from Nashville, TN! 
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a cool project called Fairy Chess. It's like regular chess, but with new pieces, different variants, and other features. Also, I will complete my bachelor's in computer science in May 2022!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Tailwind CSS for front-end styling, and MongoDB and Node.js for back-end.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about basketball, guitar, and anything tech!
